Django Messaging is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing Django projects. Just follow the Installation Guide . Does Django Messaging work with custom user models? \u00b6 Yes, Django Messaging fully supports custom user models configured via the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting. Features \u00b6 What's the difference between WebSocket and polling? \u00b6 WebSocket : Real-time, instant message delivery Requires Redis and Django Channels More complex setup Better for high-traffic sites Polling : Near real-time (3-second delay) No Redis required Simple setup Better for small to medium sites See WebSocket Setup and Polling Setup for details. Can users edit or delete messages? \u00b6 Yes, users can edit and delete their own messages. These features can be disabled in settings: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"ALLOW_EDITING_OWN_MESSAGES\" : False , \"ALLOW_DELETING_OWN_MESSAGES\" : False , } Does Django Messaging support emoji reactions? \u00b6 Yes! Users can react to messages with emojis. This feature can be disabled: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"ALLOW_ADDING_REACTIONS\" : False , } Can I create group chats? \u00b6 Yes, Django Messaging supports: Direct messages (1-on-1) Group chats (multiple users) Chat rooms (attached to content objects) Does it support read receipts? \u00b6 Yes, Django Messaging tracks which users have read each message and displays read receipts. Are there typing indicators? \u00b6 Yes, typing indicators show when other users are typing in a chat. Customization \u00b6 Can I customize the appearance? \u00b6 Yes!

Can I control who can message whom? \u00b6 Yes, you can customize the contact list function to control which users can message each other: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"GET_CONTACT_LIST_FUNCTION\" : \"myapp.utils.get_contact_list\" , } See Configuration . Can I use my own user avatars? \u00b6 Yes, customize the avatar function to use your own user profile images: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"GET_USER_AVATAR_URL_FUNCTION\" : \"myapp.utils.get_user_avatar_url\" , } Can I change how user names are displayed? \u00b6 Yes, customize the user name function: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"GET_USER_NAME_FUNCTION\" : \"myapp.utils.get_user_name\" , } Deployment \u00b6 How do I deploy Django Messaging in production? \u00b6 For polling transport , use any standard WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.). For WebSocket transport , use an ASGI server: Daphne Uvicorn Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers See WebSocket Setup . Do I need a special server for WebSocket? \u00b6 Yes, WebSocket requires an ASGI server. However, you can use polling transport with standard WSGI servers if you prefer. Can I use Django Messaging on shared hosting? \u00b6 Yes, if you use polling transport. WebSocket may not be available on all shared hosting platforms. How do I handle static files? \u00b6 Use Django's standard static file handling: python manage.py collectstatic Then serve static files with your web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) or a CDN. Performance \u00b6 How many concurrent users can Django Messaging handle? \u00b6 This depends on your infrastructure and transport method: Polling : Suitable for small to medium sites (< 500 concurrent users) WebSocket : Can handle thousands of concurrent users with proper infrastructure Will Django Messaging slow down my site? \u00b6 No, Django Messaging is designed to be lightweight and efficient: Lazy loading of messages Efficient database queries Pagination Optional caching Should I use caching? \u00b6 Yes, consider caching for: User lists Chat metadata Frequently accessed data Use Django's caching framework with Redis or Memcached. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Messages aren't appearing in real-time \u00b6 For WebSocket : 1. Verify Redis is running: redis-cli ping 2. Check WebSocket connection in browser console 3. Verify TRANSPORT is set to \"websocket\" For Polling : 1. Check browser console for errors 2. Verify API endpoints are accessible 3. Check that polling is working (Network tab) I get \"WebSocket connection failed\" \u00b6 Verify Redis is running Check CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration Ensure ASGI_APPLICATION is set correctly Check that you're using an ASGI server (Daphne/Uvicorn) Static files aren't loading \u00b6 Run python manage.py collectstatic Check STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings Verify web server is serving static files correctly I can't see the messaging interface \u00b6 Verify you're logged in Check that django_messaging is in INSTALLED_APPS Verify URLs are configured correctly Check browser console for JavaScript errors Integration \u00b6 Can I embed chat widgets in my pages? \u00b6 Yes! Django Messaging provides two embeddable widgets: DM widget for user profiles Room widget for content objects See Embedding Widgets . Can I attach chat rooms to my models? \u00b6 Yes, you can attach a chat room to any Django model instance: {% include \"messaging/includes/room.html\" with content_object = my_object %} Does Django Messaging have an API? \u00b6 Yes, Django Messaging provides a complete REST API for all messaging operations.

Prerequisites \u00b6 Before installing Django Messaging, ensure you have: Python 3.8 or higher Django 4.2 or higher A Django project set up and running Step 1: Purchase and Download \u00b6 Get the django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl package from Gumroad . Step 2: Install the Package \u00b6 There are two ways to install the package: Option A: Using requirements.txt (Recommended) \u00b6 Create a directory private_wheels/ in your project's repository: mkdir private_wheels Copy the wheel file to this directory: cp /path/to/django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl private_wheels/ Add the package to your requirements.txt : Django>=4.2 djangorestframework>=3.14 file:./private_wheels/django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl Install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt Option B: Direct Installation \u00b6 Install the wheel file directly: pip install /path/to/django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl Step 3: Add to INSTALLED_APPS \u00b6 Add django_messaging to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py : INSTALLED_APPS = [ # For WebSocket support (optional, add before django.contrib apps) \"daphne\" , # Only if using WebSocket transport # Django contrib apps \"django.contrib.admin\" , \"django.contrib.auth\" , \"django.contrib.contenttypes\" , \"django.contrib.sessions\" , \"django.contrib.messages\" , \"django.contrib.staticfiles\" , # Third-party apps \"rest_framework\" , # Required \"django_messaging\" , # Add this # Your apps # ... ] Note If you plan to use WebSocket transport, add \"daphne\" before the Django contrib apps. For polling transport, you can skip this. Step 4: Add Context Processor \u00b6 Add the context processor to your TEMPLATES configuration in settings.py : TEMPLATES = [ { \"BACKEND\" : \"django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates\" , \"DIRS\" : [], \"APP_DIRS\" : True , \"OPTIONS\" : { \"context_processors\" : [ \"django.template.context_processors.debug\" , \"django.template.context_processors.request\" , \"django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth\" , \"django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages\" , \"django_messaging.context_processors.messaging_settings\" , # Add this ], }, }, ] Step 5: Configure URLs \u00b6 Include the app URLs in your project's urls.py : from django.urls import path , include urlpatterns = [ # ... your other URL patterns path ( \"messages/\" , include ( \"django_messaging.urls\" )), ] Tip You can use any URL prefix you prefer. For example, path(\"chat/\", include(\"django_messaging.urls\")) would make the messaging interface available at /chat/ . Step 6: Run Migrations \u00b6 Apply the database migrations: python manage.py migrate Step 7: Collect Static Files \u00b6 Collect the static files for production: python manage.py collectstatic Verify Installation \u00b6 To verify that Django Messaging is installed correctly: Start your development server: python manage.py runserver Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/messages/ in your browser You should see the messaging interface (you'll need to be logged in) Next Steps \u00b6 Now that Django Messaging is installed, you can: Follow the Quick Start Guide to set up your first chat Configure WebSocket support for real-time messaging Or use Polling transport for a simpler setup Customize the app with Configuration options Troubleshooting \u00b6 Import Error \u00b6 If you get an import error, make sure: The package is installed in your virtual environment django_messaging is in your INSTALLED_APPS You've activated your virtual environment Static Files Not Loading \u00b6 If static files aren't loading: Run python manage.py collectstatic Check that django.contrib.staticfiles is in INSTALLED_APPS Verify your STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings Database Errors \u00b6 If you get database errors: Make sure you've run python manage.py migrate Check that your database is properly configured in settings.py","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#installation","text":"This guide will walk you through installing Django Messaging in your Django project.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#prerequisites","text":"Before installing Django Messaging, ensure you have: Python 3.8 or higher Django 4.2 or higher A Django project set up and running","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#step-1-purchase-and-download","text":"Get the django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl package from Gumroad .","title":"Step 1: Purchase and Download"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#step-2-install-the-package","text":"There are two ways to install the package:","title":"Step 2: Install the Package"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#option-a-using-requirementstxt-recommended","text":"Create a directory private_wheels/ in your project's repository: mkdir private_wheels Copy the wheel file to this directory: cp /path/to/django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl private_wheels/ Add the package to your requirements.txt : Django>=4.2 djangorestframework>=3.14 file:./private_wheels/django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl Install the requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt","title":"Option A: Using requirements.txt (Recommended)"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#option-b-direct-installation","text":"Install the wheel file directly: pip install /path/to/django_messaging-0.17.0-py3-none-any.whl","title":"Option B: Direct Installation"},{"location":"getting-started/installation/#step-3-add-to-installed_apps","text":"Add django_messaging to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py : INSTALLED_APPS = [ # For WebSocket support (optional, add before django.contrib apps) \"daphne\" , # Only if using WebSocket transport # Django contrib apps \"django.contrib.admin\" , \"django.contrib.auth\" , \"django.contrib.contenttypes\" , \"django.contrib.sessions\" , \"django.contrib.messages\" , \"django.contrib.staticfiles\" , # Third-party apps \"rest_framework\" , # Required \"django_messaging\" , # Add this # Your apps # ... ] Note If you plan to use WebSocket transport, add \"daphne\" before the Django contrib apps.

This guide covers various ways to customize the appearance and behavior of the messaging interface. Template Customization \u00b6 Override Templates \u00b6 You can override any template by creating your own version in your project's template directory. Django's template loading system will use your templates instead of the app's defaults. myproject/ templates/ messaging/ base.html # Override base template messaging.html # Override main chat page includes/ dm.html # Override DM widget room.html # Override chat room widget button.html # Override button component context_menu_item.html # Override context menu items Key Templates \u00b6 Base Template \u00b6 Override messaging/base.html to integrate with your site's layout: {# templates/messaging/base.html #} {% extends \"site_base.html\" %} {% block title %} Messages {% endblock %} {% block content %} {# Messaging interface content #} {% endblock %} Chat Page \u00b6 Override messaging/messaging.html to customize the main messaging interface. DM Widget \u00b6 Override messaging/includes/dm.html to customize the embedded DM widget: {# templates/messaging/includes/dm.html #} <div class=\"custom-dm-widget\"> {# Your custom DM widget HTML #} </div> Room Widget \u00b6 Override messaging/includes/room.html to customize the embedded chat room: {# templates/messaging/includes/room.html #} <div class=\"custom-room-widget\"> {# Your custom room widget HTML #} </div> Styling Customization \u00b6 Django Messaging uses Tailwind CSS for styling with built-in dark mode support. Tailwind CSS Integration \u00b6 The app uses Tailwind CSS with the class dark mode strategy. To enable dark mode in your project, add the dark class to the <html> or <body> element: < html class = \"dark\" > <!-- Dark mode enabled --> </ html > Or toggle it dynamically with JavaScript: // Toggle dark mode document . documentElement . classList . toggle ( 'dark' ); // Enable dark mode document . documentElement . classList . add ( 'dark' ); // Disable dark mode document . documentElement . classList . remove ( 'dark' ); Dark Mode \u00b6 Django Messaging includes built-in dark mode support using Tailwind's dark: variant. The app automatically adapts to the dark mode state when the dark class is present on the document element. Key dark mode styles include: Backgrounds : dark:bg-gray-800 , dark:bg-gray-900 Text : dark:text-gray-100 , dark:text-gray-400 Borders : dark:border-gray-700 Custom components : Reactions, messages, and search results have specific dark mode styles Customizing Colors \u00b6 Django Messaging loads Tailwind CSS from CDN and uses inline utility classes. To customize the appearance, create a custom stylesheet and override specific components: /* Custom dark mode colors for reactions */ . dark . reaction { background-color : #1e293b ; border-color : #334155 ; } /* Custom search result highlighting */ . dark . search-result { border-color : #f59e0b ; background-color : #451a03 ; } /* Custom message colors */ . dark . message-deleted . message-content { color : #9ca3af ; } /* Override message bubble colors */ . message-bubble-own { background-color : #3b82f6 !important ; } . message-bubble-other { background-color : #f3f4f6 !important ; } . dark . message-bubble-other { background-color : #374151 !important ; } Why Custom CSS? Django Messaging uses Tailwind CSS from CDN, which means you cannot extend a tailwind.config.js file. All customization must be done through custom CSS that overrides the default styles. Custom CSS Classes \u00b6 Add custom CSS classes to specific elements using the template system: {# In your custom template #} <div class=\"messaging-container my-custom-class\"> {# Content #} </div> External Stylesheet \u00b6 Link your custom stylesheet in the base template: {% block extra_css %} <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\" {% static 'css/custom-messaging.css' %} \"> {% endblock %} Customizable Functions \u00b6 User Display Name \u00b6 Customize how user names are displayed: # myapp/utils.py def get_user_name ( user ): \"\"\"Return custom display name\"\"\" if hasattr ( user , \"profile\" ): return user . profile . display_name return user . get_full_name () or user . username # settings.py DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"GET_USER_NAME_FUNCTION\" : \"myapp.utils.get_user_name\" , } User Avatar \u00b6 Customize user avatars: # myapp/utils.py def get_user_avatar_url ( user ): \"\"\"Return user avatar URL\"\"\" if hasattr ( user , \"profile\" ) and user . profile . avatar : return user . profile . avatar . url # Fallback to default from django_messaging.defaults import get_user_avatar_url as default_avatar return default_avatar ( user ) # settings.py DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"GET_USER_AVATAR_URL_FUNCTION\" : \"myapp.utils.get_user_avatar_url\" , } Contact List \u00b6 Customize who can message whom: # myapp/utils.py from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model User = get_user_model () def get_contact_list ( user ): \"\"\"Return users in the same organization\"\"\" if not hasattr ( user , \"organization\" ): return User . objects . none () return User . objects . filter ( organization = user . organization , is_active = True ) . exclude ( pk = user . pk ) # settings.py DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"GET_CONTACT_LIST_FUNCTION\" : \"myapp.utils.get_contact_list\" , } Layout Customization \u00b6 Adjust for Your Navigation \u00b6 Configure layout offsets to match your site's navigation: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { # Height of your top navigation \"TOP_NAVIGATION_HEIGHT\" : \"64px\" , # Total offset from top (navigation + margins) \"CONTENT_TOP_OFFSET\" : \"96px\" , # Bottom padding \"CONTENT_BOTTOM_OFFSET\" : \"32px\" , } Responsive Breakpoints \u00b6 Customize responsive behavior by overriding CSS: /* Custom breakpoints */ @ media ( max-width : 768px ) { . messaging-container { /* Mobile styles */ } } @ media ( min-width : 769px ) and ( max-width : 1024px ) { . messaging-container { /* Tablet styles */ } } @ media ( min-width : 1025px ) { . messaging-container { /* Desktop styles */ } } Feature Customization \u00b6 Disable Features \u00b6 Disable features you don't need: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"ALLOW_EDITING_OWN_MESSAGES\" : False , \"ALLOW_DELETING_OWN_MESSAGES\" : False , \"ALLOW_ADDING_REACTIONS\" : False , \"ALLOW_RENAMING_CHAT_ROOMS\" : False , \"ALLOW_RENAMING_DMS\" : False , } Hide UI Elements \u00b6 Hide specific UI elements: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"SHOW_DELETED_MESSAGE_INDICATORS\" : False , \"SHOW_CHAT_ROOMS_IN_MESSAGES\" : False , \"SHOW_DMS_IN_MESSAGES\" : False , } Internationalization \u00b6 Add Translations \u00b6 Django Messaging is translation-ready. Add your translations: # Create locale directory mkdir -p locale # Generate message files python manage.py makemessages -l es python manage.py makemessages -l fr python manage.py makemessages -l de # Edit .po files in locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/django.po # Compile messages python manage.py compilemessages Custom Text \u00b6 Override specific text by creating custom templates or using translation overrides. JavaScript Customization \u00b6 No Custom Events API Django Messaging does not currently dispatch custom JavaScript events. The messaging functionality is handled internally by the ChatApp , DMApp , and RoomApp classes. To extend functionality, you would need to modify the JavaScript files directly or override the templates. Accessing the Chat Instance \u00b6 The main chat application instance is available globally: // Access the chat app instance (on the messages page) const chatApp = window . chatApp ; // Access current chat ID console . log ( chatApp . currentChatId ); // Access chat data console . log ( chatApp . chats ); Extending via Template Overrides \u00b6 To add custom JavaScript functionality, override the messaging templates and add your own scripts: {# templates/messaging/messaging.html #} {% extends \"messaging/messaging.html\" %} {% block extra_body %} {{ block .super }} <script> // Add your custom JavaScript here // You can access window.chatApp after DOMContentLoaded document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => { console.log('Chat app initialized:', window.chatApp); // Example: Monitor when messages are sent // (You would need to modify the ChatApp class to add hooks) }); </script> {% endblock %} Advanced Customization \u00b6 Custom Message Rendering \u00b6 Override message rendering by customizing templates: {# templates/messaging/includes/message.html #} <div class=\"message {% if message.is_own %} message-own {% endif %} \"> <div class=\"message-avatar\"> <img src=\" {{ message.sender.avatar_url }} \" alt=\" {{ message.sender.name }} \"> </div> <div class=\"message-content\"> <div class=\"message-header\"> <span class=\"message-sender\"> {{ message.sender.name }} </span> <span class=\"message-time\"> {{ message.created_at | date :\"H:i\" }} </span> </div> <div class=\"message-body\"> {{ message.content | linebreaks }} </div> </div> </div> Custom Chat List Item \u00b6 Customize how chats appear in the list: {# templates/messaging/includes/chat_list_item.html #} <div class=\"chat-item {% if chat.has_unread %} chat-unread {% endif %} \"> <div class=\"chat-avatar\"> {# Custom avatar rendering #} </div> <div class=\"chat-info\"> <div class=\"chat-title\"> {{ chat.title }} </div> <div class=\"chat-preview\"> {{ chat.last_message.content | truncatewords : 10 }} </div> </div> <div class=\"chat-meta\"> <div class=\"chat-time\"> {{ chat.last_message.created_at | timesince }} </div> {% if chat.unread_count %} <div class=\"chat-badge\"> {{ chat.unread_count }} </div> {% endif %} </div> </div> Next Steps \u00b6 Explore the API Reference for programmatic customization Check Template Tags for available template helpers Review Settings Reference for all configuration options","title":"Customization"},{"location":"guides/customization/#customization","text":"Django Messaging is designed to be highly customizable.

This guide covers how to use the DM widget and chat room widget. Overview \u00b6 Django Messaging offers two embeddable widgets: DM Widget - Direct message widget for user profiles Room Widget - Chat room widget for content objects Both widgets are self-contained and can be easily integrated into your existing templates. DM Widget \u00b6 The DM widget allows users to send direct messages from another user's profile page. Basic Usage \u00b6 Include the DM widget in a user profile template: {# user_profile.html #} {% load static %} <div class=\"user-profile\"> <h1> {{ profile_user.get_full_name }} </h1> <p> {{ profile_user.email }} </p> {% if MESSAGING_SETTINGS.ENABLE_DMS and request.user.is_authenticated and request.user != profile_user %} {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = profile_user %} {% endif %} </div> Required Context \u00b6 The DM widget requires: contact_user - The user to message (User object) request.user - The current user (automatically available) Configuration \u00b6 Enable/disable the DM widget in settings: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"ENABLE_DMS\" : True , # Enable DM widget \"SHOW_DMS_IN_MESSAGES\" : True , # Show DMs in main messages page } How It Works \u00b6 The DM widget: Creates a chat between the current user and the contact user (if it doesn't exist) Displays the chat interface inline Allows sending and receiving messages Updates in real-time (with WebSocket) or periodically (with polling) Use Cases \u00b6 User Profiles : Allow users to message each other from profile pages Team Member Pages : Enable direct communication with team members Marketplace : Let buyers message sellers Social Networks : Facilitate user-to-user communication Example: User Directory \u00b6 {# user_directory.html #} {% load static %} <div class=\"user-directory\"> <h1>Team Members</h1> {% for member in team_members %} <div class=\"member-card\"> <img src=\" {{ member.profile.avatar.url }} \" alt=\" {{ member.get_full_name }} \"> <h3> {{ member.get_full_name }} </h3> <p> {{ member.profile.title }} </p> {% if request.user != member %} {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = member %} {% endif %} </div> {% endfor %} </div> Room Widget \u00b6 The room widget creates a chat room attached to any content object (e.g., blog post, project, event). Basic Usage \u00b6 Include the room widget in a detail template: {# blog_post_detail.html #} {% load static %} <article class=\"blog-post\"> <h1> {{ post.title }} </h1> <div class=\"post-content\"> {{ post.content | safe }} </div> </article> {% if MESSAGING_SETTINGS.ENABLE_CHAT_ROOMS %} <section class=\"discussion-section\"> <h2>Discussion</h2> {% include \"messaging/includes/room.html\" with content_object = post %} </section> {% endif %} Required Context \u00b6 The room widget requires: content_object - The object to attach the chat room to (any Django model instance) request.user - The current user (automatically available) Configuration \u00b6 Enable/disable the room widget in settings: DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"ENABLE_CHAT_ROOMS\" : True , # Enable room widget \"SHOW_CHAT_ROOMS_IN_MESSAGES\" : True , # Show rooms in main messages page } How It Works \u00b6 The room widget: Creates a chat room for the content object (if it doesn't exist) Automatically adds the current user as a member Displays the chat interface inline Allows all members to send and receive messages Updates in real-time (with WebSocket) or periodically (with polling) Use Cases \u00b6 Blog Posts : Discussion section for blog posts Projects : Team communication for projects Events : Chat room for event attendees Products : Q&A section for products Courses : Discussion forum for course lessons Example: Project Detail \u00b6 {# project_detail.html #} {% load static %} <div class=\"project-detail\"> <h1> {{ project.name }} </h1> <p> {{ project.description }} </p> <div class=\"project-team\"> <h2>Team Members</h2> <ul> {% for member in project.members.all %} <li> {{ member.get_full_name }} </li> {% endfor %} </ul> </div> {% if MESSAGING_SETTINGS.ENABLE_CHAT_ROOMS %} <div class=\"project-chat\"> <h2>Team Chat</h2> {% include \"messaging/includes/room.html\" with content_object = project %} </div> {% endif %} </div> Example: Event Page \u00b6 {# event_detail.html #} {% load static %} <div class=\"event-detail\"> <h1> {{ event.title }} </h1> <p><strong>Date:</strong> {{ event.date }} </p> <p><strong>Location:</strong> {{ event.location }} </p> <div class=\"event-description\"> {{ event.description | safe }} </div> {% if MESSAGING_SETTINGS.ENABLE_CHAT_ROOMS and user.is_authenticated %} <div class=\"event-chat\"> <h2>Event Chat</h2> <p>Connect with other attendees</p> {% include \"messaging/includes/room.html\" with content_object = event %} </div> {% endif %} </div> Advanced Usage \u00b6 Custom Widget Styling \u00b6 Wrap widgets in custom containers for styling: <div class=\"custom-widget-container\"> <div class=\"widget-header\"> <h3>Send a Message</h3> </div> <div class=\"widget-body\"> {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = profile_user %} </div> </div> . custom-widget-container { border : 1 px solid #ddd ; border-radius : 8 px ; padding : 1 rem ; background : #f9f9f9 ; } . widget-header { margin-bottom : 1 rem ; padding-bottom : 0.5 rem ; border-bottom : 1 px solid #ddd ; } Conditional Display \u00b6 Show widgets based on permissions: {# Only show to authenticated users #} {% if request.user.is_authenticated %} {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = profile_user %} {% endif %} {# Only show to team members #} {% if request.user in project.members.all %} {% include \"messaging/includes/room.html\" with content_object = project %} {% endif %} {# Only show to premium users #} {% if request.user.profile.is_premium %} {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = support_user %} {% endif %} Multiple Widgets on One Page \u00b6 You can include multiple widgets on the same page: <div class=\"contact-page\"> <h1>Contact Us</h1> <div class=\"contact-options\"> <div class=\"contact-option\"> <h2>Sales</h2> {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = sales_user %} </div> <div class=\"contact-option\"> <h2>Support</h2> {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = support_user %} </div> <div class=\"contact-option\"> <h2>General Inquiries</h2> {% include \"messaging/includes/dm.html\" with contact_user = info_user %} </div> </div> </div> Customizing Widget Templates \u00b6 Override widget templates for complete customization: myproject/ templates/ messaging/ includes/ dm.html # Custom DM widget room.html # Custom room widget Example custom DM widget: {# templates/messaging/includes/dm.html #} <div class=\"my-custom-dm-widget\"> <div class=\"dm-header\"> <h3>Message {{ contact_user.get_full_name }} </h3> </div> <div class=\"dm-messages\"> {# Your custom message list #} </div> <div class=\"dm-input\"> {# Your custom input form #} </div> </div> Best Practices \u00b6 Performance \u00b6 Lazy Loading : Widgets load messages on demand Pagination : Only recent messages are loaded initially Caching : Consider caching user lists and chat metadata User Experience \u00b6 Clear Labels : Make it clear what the widget does Responsive Design : Ensure widgets work on mobile devices Loading States : Show loading indicators while data loads Security \u00b6 Authentication : Always check if user is authenticated Permissions : Verify user has permission to access the chat Validation : Validate all user input Accessibility \u00b6 Keyboard Navigation : Ensure widgets are keyboard accessible Screen Readers : Use proper ARIA labels Focus Management : Manage focus appropriately Troubleshooting \u00b6 Widget Not Appearing \u00b6 Problem : Widget doesn't show up on the page. Solutions : Check that the feature is enabled in settings Verify the user is authenticated Check template syntax and variable names Look for JavaScript errors in browser console Messages Not Loading \u00b6 Problem : Widget appears but messages don't load.

This guide will help you set up polling transport for Django Messaging. Overview \u00b6 Polling transport: \u2705 Simple setup - No Redis or Django Channels required \u2705 Works with standard Django - Uses regular WSGI servers \u2705 Easy deployment - No special server configuration needed \u26a0\ufe0f Slight delay - Messages appear with a small delay (configurable) \u26a0\ufe0f More server requests - Clients poll the server periodically When to Use Polling \u00b6 Polling is ideal for: Development and testing - Quick setup without additional dependencies Small to medium sites - Where real-time delivery isn't critical Shared hosting - Where WebSocket support isn't available Simple deployments - Where you want to avoid Redis setup Consider WebSocket if you need: Instant message delivery High-traffic sites with many concurrent users Real-time typing indicators and presence Step 1: Configure Polling Transport \u00b6 Add this to your settings.py : DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"TRANSPORT\" : \"polling\" , } That's it! No additional dependencies or configuration required. Step 2: Run the Development Server \u00b6 Use the standard Django development server: python manage.py runserver How Polling Works \u00b6 With polling transport: The client sends periodic requests to the server (every 3 seconds by default) The server checks for new messages and returns them The client updates the UI with any new messages The process repeats This creates a near-real-time experience with minimal setup. Customizing Polling Behavior \u00b6 While the polling interval is not directly configurable through settings, you can customize it by overriding the JavaScript if needed. Default Behavior \u00b6 Polling interval : 3 seconds Timeout : 30 seconds per request Retry on error : Automatic with exponential backoff Production Deployment \u00b6 Polling works with any standard WSGI server: Using Gunicorn \u00b6 pip install gunicorn gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application --bind 0 .0.0.0:8000 --workers 4 Systemd Service for Gunicorn \u00b6 Create /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service : [Unit] Description = Gunicorn WSGI Server for Django Messaging After = network.target [Service] Type = notify User = www-data Group = www-data WorkingDirectory = /var/www/myproject Environment = \"PATH=/var/www/myproject/venv/bin\" ExecStart = /var/www/myproject/venv/bin/gunicorn \\ myproject.wsgi:application \\ --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \\ --workers 4 \\ --log-level info \\ --access-logfile /var/log/gunicorn/access.log \\ --error-logfile /var/log/gunicorn/error.log Restart = always RestartSec = 10 [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Create log directory and enable the service: sudo mkdir -p /var/log/gunicorn sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/gunicorn sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable gunicorn sudo systemctl start gunicorn sudo systemctl status gunicorn Using uWSGI \u00b6 pip install uwsgi uwsgi --http :8000 --module myproject.wsgi:application --workers 4 Systemd Service for uWSGI \u00b6 Create /etc/systemd/system/uwsgi.service : [Unit] Description = uWSGI Server for Django Messaging After = network.target [Service] Type = notify User = www-data Group = www-data WorkingDirectory = /var/www/myproject Environment = \"PATH=/var/www/myproject/venv/bin\" ExecStart = /var/www/myproject/venv/bin/uwsgi \\ --http :8000 \\ --module myproject.wsgi:application \\ --workers 4 \\ --master \\ --enable-threads \\ --logto /var/log/uwsgi/uwsgi.log Restart = always RestartSec = 10 [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Create log directory and enable the service: sudo mkdir -p /var/log/uwsgi sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/uwsgi sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable uwsgi sudo systemctl start uwsgi sudo systemctl status uwsgi Using mod_wsgi (Apache) \u00b6 Configure Apache with mod_wsgi as you normally would for Django applications. Systemd Service Configuration Notes \u00b6 Important settings to customize: User and Group : Change from www-data to your application user WorkingDirectory : Set to your Django project root directory Environment=\"PATH=...\" : Set to your virtual environment's bin directory ExecStart : Update paths to match your installation --workers : Adjust based on CPU cores (typically 2-4 \u00d7 CPU cores) Useful systemd commands: # View logs sudo journalctl -u gunicorn -f sudo journalctl -u uwsgi -f # Restart service sudo systemctl restart gunicorn sudo systemctl restart uwsgi # Stop service sudo systemctl stop gunicorn # Check status sudo systemctl status gunicorn Nginx Configuration \u00b6 Example Nginx configuration for polling transport: upstream django { server 127.0.0.1 : 8000 ; } server { listen 80 ; server_name example.com ; location / { proxy_pass http://django ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; } location /static/ { alias /path/to/staticfiles/ ; } location /media/ { alias /path/to/media/ ; } } Performance Considerations \u00b6 Server Load \u00b6 Polling creates more HTTP requests than WebSocket. For a site with 100 concurrent users: Polling : ~33 requests/second (100 users \u00d7 1 request/3 seconds) WebSocket : Minimal overhead (persistent connections) Optimization Tips \u00b6 Use caching - Cache user lists and chat metadata Database indexing - Ensure proper indexes on message queries Pagination - Limit messages returned per request CDN for static files - Reduce server load When to Switch to WebSocket \u00b6 Consider switching to WebSocket if: You have > 500 concurrent users Server load becomes an issue You need instant message delivery You want typing indicators and presence Advantages of Polling \u00b6 Simplicity \u00b6 No Redis installation or management No Django Channels configuration Works with standard Django deployment Compatibility \u00b6 Works on any hosting platform No special server requirements Compatible with all browsers Reliability \u00b6 Automatic reconnection on network issues No WebSocket connection drops Works behind restrictive firewalls Limitations of Polling \u00b6 Delay \u00b6 Messages appear with a 0-3 second delay (average 1.5 seconds). Server Load \u00b6 More HTTP requests compared to WebSocket. Features \u00b6 Some features work differently: Typing indicators : Updated every 3 seconds instead of instantly Read receipts : Updated on next poll instead of immediately Presence : Updated periodically instead of in real-time Switching from Polling to WebSocket \u00b6 To upgrade from polling to WebSocket later: Follow the WebSocket Setup Guide Change TRANSPORT setting to \"websocket\" Restart your server No database changes or data migration required! Troubleshooting \u00b6 Messages Not Appearing \u00b6 Problem : New messages don't appear in the chat. Solutions : Check browser console for errors Verify TRANSPORT is set to \"polling\" Check that the API endpoints are accessible Verify user is authenticated High Server Load \u00b6 Problem : Server experiencing high load with polling. Solutions : Implement database query optimization Add caching for frequently accessed data Increase polling interval (requires JavaScript customization) Consider switching to WebSocket Polling Requests Failing \u00b6 Problem : Polling requests return errors. Solutions : Check server logs for error details Verify API endpoints are working: /messages/api/chats/ Check authentication middleware is configured Verify CSRF token handling Complete Configuration Example \u00b6 Here's a complete configuration for polling transport: # settings.py DJANGO_MESSAGING = { # Use polling transport \"TRANSPORT\" : \"polling\" , # Pagination (keep these reasonable for polling) \"MESSAGES_PER_PAGE\" : 50 , \"CHATS_PER_PAGE\" : 10 , # Layout settings \"TOP_NAVIGATION_HEIGHT\" : \"64px\" , \"CONTENT_TOP_OFFSET\" : \"96px\" , \"CONTENT_BOTTOM_OFFSET\" : \"32px\" , # Features \"ENABLE_CHAT_ROOMS\" : True , \"ENABLE_DMS\" : True , \"SHOW_CHAT_ROOMS_IN_MESSAGES\" : True , \"SHOW_DMS_IN_MESSAGES\" : True , # Permissions \"ALLOW_EDITING_OWN_MESSAGES\" : True , \"ALLOW_DELETING_OWN_MESSAGES\" : True , \"ALLOW_ADDING_REACTIONS\" : True , } # Standard Django settings (no Channels required) INSTALLED_APPS = [ \"django.contrib.admin\" , \"django.contrib.auth\" , \"django.contrib.contenttypes\" , \"django.contrib.sessions\" , \"django.contrib.messages\" , \"django.contrib.staticfiles\" , \"rest_framework\" , \"django_messaging\" , # Your apps ] Next Steps \u00b6 Learn about Customization options Explore Embedding Widgets Check the API Reference Review Configuration Options Consider WebSocket Setup for real-time messaging","title":"Polling Setup"},{"location":"guides/polling-setup/#polling-setup","text":"Polling transport provides a simpler alternative to WebSocket for message delivery.

Step 3: Configure ASGI Application \u00b6 Create or modify your project's asgi.py file: # myproject/asgi.py import os from django.core.asgi import get_asgi_application from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter , URLRouter from channels.auth import AuthMiddlewareStack from django_messaging.routing import websocket_urlpatterns os . environ . setdefault ( \"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\" , \"myproject.settings\" ) application = ProtocolTypeRouter ( { \"http\" : get_asgi_application (), \"websocket\" : AuthMiddlewareStack ( URLRouter ( websocket_urlpatterns ) ), } ) Step 4: Configure Django Settings \u00b6 Add the following to your settings.py : # ASGI application ASGI_APPLICATION = \"myproject.asgi.application\" # Channel layers configuration CHANNEL_LAYERS = { \"default\" : { \"BACKEND\" : \"channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer\" , \"CONFIG\" : { \"hosts\" : [( \"127.0.0.1\" , 6379 )], }, }, } # Django Messaging configuration DJANGO_MESSAGING = { \"TRANSPORT\" : \"websocket\" , # ... other settings } Redis Configuration Options \u00b6 Local Redis (Development) \u00b6 CHANNEL_LAYERS = { \"default\" : { \"BACKEND\" : \"channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer\" , \"CONFIG\" : { \"hosts\" : [( \"127.0.0.1\" , 6379 )], }, }, } Remote Redis (Production) \u00b6 CHANNEL_LAYERS = { \"default\" : { \"BACKEND\" : \"channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer\" , \"CONFIG\" : { \"hosts\" : [( \"redis.example.com\" , 6379 )], }, }, } Redis with Authentication \u00b6 CHANNEL_LAYERS = { \"default\" : { \"BACKEND\" : \"channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer\" , \"CONFIG\" : { \"hosts\" : [ { \"address\" : \"redis://username:password@redis.example.com:6379/0\" , } ], }, }, } Redis Sentinel (High Availability) \u00b6 CHANNEL_LAYERS = { \"default\" : { \"BACKEND\" : \"channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer\" , \"CONFIG\" : { \"hosts\" : [ { \"sentinels\" : [ ( \"sentinel1.example.com\" , 26379 ), ( \"sentinel2.example.com\" , 26379 ), ( \"sentinel3.example.com\" , 26379 ), ], \"master_name\" : \"mymaster\" , } ], }, }, } Step 5: Install and Start Redis \u00b6 Using Docker (Recommended for Development) \u00b6 docker run -p 6379 :6379 -d redis:latest Using Homebrew (macOS) \u00b6 # Install Redis brew install redis # Start Redis service brew services start redis # Or run manually redis-server Using apt (Ubuntu/Debian) \u00b6 # Install Redis sudo apt update sudo apt install redis-server # Start Redis service sudo systemctl start redis-server # Enable Redis to start on boot sudo systemctl enable redis-server Verify Redis is Running \u00b6 redis-cli ping You should see PONG as the response. Step 6: Run the Development Server \u00b6 Using Daphne \u00b6 With Daphne installed and in INSTALLED_APPS , you can use the standard Django command: python manage.py runserver Daphne will automatically handle both HTTP and WebSocket connections. Using Uvicorn \u00b6 uvicorn myproject.asgi:application --host 127 .0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload Step 7: Test WebSocket Connection \u00b6 Open your browser's developer console (F12) Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/messages/ Look for WebSocket connection messages in the console You should see something like: WebSocket connection established Production Deployment \u00b6 Using Daphne \u00b6 For production with Daphne: daphne -b 0 .0.0.0 -p 8000 myproject.asgi:application Systemd Service for Daphne \u00b6 Create /etc/systemd/system/daphne.service : [Unit] Description = Daphne ASGI Server for Django Messaging After = network.target redis.service [Service] Type = simple User = www-data Group = www-data WorkingDirectory = /var/www/myproject Environment = \"PATH=/var/www/myproject/venv/bin\" ExecStart = /var/www/myproject/venv/bin/daphne \\ -b 0.0.0.0 \\ -p 8000 \\ myproject.asgi:application Restart = always RestartSec = 10 [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Enable and start the service: sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable daphne sudo systemctl start daphne sudo systemctl status daphne Using Uvicorn \u00b6 For production with Uvicorn: uvicorn myproject.asgi:application --host 0 .0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 4 Systemd Service for Uvicorn \u00b6 Create /etc/systemd/system/uvicorn.service : [Unit] Description = Uvicorn ASGI Server for Django Messaging After = network.target redis.service [Service] Type = simple User = www-data Group = www-data WorkingDirectory = /var/www/myproject Environment = \"PATH=/var/www/myproject/venv/bin\" ExecStart = /var/www/myproject/venv/bin/uvicorn \\ myproject.asgi:application \\ --host 0.0.0.0 \\ --port 8000 \\ --workers 4 \\ --log-level info Restart = always RestartSec = 10 [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Enable and start the service: sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable uvicorn sudo systemctl start uvicorn sudo systemctl status uvicorn Using Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers \u00b6 pip install gunicorn uvicorn gunicorn myproject.asgi:application \\ -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \\ --bind 0 .0.0.0:8000 \\ --workers 4 Systemd Service for Gunicorn + Uvicorn \u00b6 Create /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service : [Unit] Description = Gunicorn ASGI Server with Uvicorn Workers for Django Messaging After = network.target redis.service [Service] Type = notify User = www-data Group = www-data WorkingDirectory = /var/www/myproject Environment = \"PATH=/var/www/myproject/venv/bin\" ExecStart = /var/www/myproject/venv/bin/gunicorn \\ myproject.asgi:application \\ -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker \\ --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 \\ --workers 4 \\ --log-level info \\ --access-logfile /var/log/gunicorn/access.log \\ --error-logfile /var/log/gunicorn/error.log Restart = always RestartSec = 10 [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target Create log directory: sudo mkdir -p /var/log/gunicorn sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/gunicorn Enable and start the service: sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl enable gunicorn sudo systemctl start gunicorn sudo systemctl status gunicorn Systemd Service Configuration Notes \u00b6 Important settings to customize: User and Group : Change from www-data to your application user WorkingDirectory : Set to your Django project root directory Environment=\"PATH=...\" : Set to your virtual environment's bin directory ExecStart : Update paths to match your installation --workers : Adjust based on CPU cores (typically 2-4 \u00d7 CPU cores) Useful systemd commands: # View logs sudo journalctl -u daphne -f sudo journalctl -u uvicorn -f sudo journalctl -u gunicorn -f # Restart service sudo systemctl restart daphne sudo systemctl restart uvicorn sudo systemctl restart gunicorn # Stop service sudo systemctl stop daphne # Check status sudo systemctl status daphne Nginx Configuration \u00b6 Example Nginx configuration for WebSocket support: upstream django { server 127.0.0.1 : 8000 ; } server { listen 80 ; server_name example.com ; location / { proxy_pass http://django ; proxy_http_version 1 .1 ; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade ; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\" ; proxy_set_header Host $host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; } location /static/ { alias /path/to/staticfiles/ ; } location /media/ { alias /path/to/media/ ; } } Troubleshooting \u00b6 WebSocket Connection Failed \u00b6 Problem : WebSocket connection fails in the browser console. Solutions : Verify Redis is running: redis-cli ping Check ASGI_APPLICATION setting points to correct ASGI application Ensure websocket_urlpatterns is imported correctly Check browser console for specific error messages Messages Not Appearing in Real-Time \u00b6 Problem : Messages don't appear instantly. Solutions : Verify TRANSPORT is set to \"websocket\" in settings Check WebSocket connection is established (browser console) Verify Redis is running and accessible Check CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration Redis Connection Error \u00b6 Problem : Connection refused or Cannot connect to Redis errors. Solutions : Verify Redis is running: redis-cli ping Check Redis host and port in CHANNEL_LAYERS configuration Verify firewall allows connection to Redis port Check Redis authentication if using password Import Error for websocket_urlpatterns \u00b6 Problem : ImportError: cannot import name 'websocket_urlpatterns' Solutions : Verify Django Messaging is installed: pip list | grep django-messaging Check django_messaging is in INSTALLED_APPS Restart the development server Performance Tuning \u00b6 Redis Connection Pool \u00b6 For better performance, configure Redis connection pooling: CHANNEL_LAYERS = { \"default\" : { \"BACKEND\" : \"channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer\" , \"CONFIG\" : { \"hosts\" : [( \"127.0.0.1\" , 6379 )], \"capacity\" : 1500 , \"expiry\" : 10 , }, }, } Channel Layer Capacity \u00b6 Adjust capacity based on your expected concurrent users: Small sites (< 100 concurrent users): capacity: 1500 Medium sites (100-1000 concurrent users): capacity: 5000 Large sites (> 1000 concurrent users): capacity: 10000 Next Steps \u00b6 Learn about Customization options Explore Embedding Widgets Check the API Reference Review Settings Reference","title":"WebSocket Setup"},{"location":"guides/websocket-setup/#websocket-setup","text":"WebSocket transport provides real-time, instant message delivery.
